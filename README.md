# TopoMatch

Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) is a powerful tool for cell type detection. However, for multiple
datasets, especially datasets from different scRNA-Seq technologies, comparing or merging them
remain challenging. In this paper, we showed that if measuring the same sample, the toplogies of
gene expression pattern were preserved across experiments. We have developed a method to match
clusters from multiple datasets, which only relies on distance matrices of clusters
